			CLOs are tasked with addressing quality of life issues that often times cannot be properly addressed by regular Patrol Officers due to time and resource requirements.  These quality of life issues commonly include issues including environmental concerns with residential homes (i.e. unkempt, cars parked on the lawn, homelessness, large amounts of debris, etc) and neighborhood dispute issues.  More recently, in accordance with Focus Based Policing, the CLO Detail has expanded their focus to include street level narcotics investigations, auto theft, violations of the Torrance Municipal Code and any other issues affecting the quality of life in the City of Torrance.  The Community Lead Officer Detail works out of the Community Affairs Division and is comprised of a Sergeant and four Community Lead Officers. Each Community Lead Officer (CLO) is responsible for an area of the City.
