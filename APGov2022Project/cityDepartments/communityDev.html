	<h1>Community Development</h1>

	<div>
		<p>The Community Development Department oversees a number of divisions including Building & Safety, Engineering, Planning, Environmental (Code Enforcement), Housing, and the Geographic Information System (GIS) Divisions. A total of 67 employees, with multiple disciplines and backgrounds, make up the Department’s services and specialties.
		</p>
		<p>
Staff has prepared a Year in Review Report that includes an overview of the Department’s 2020 activities. As the year began with the City’s cyber incident in February and, within weeks, transitioned into the pandemic response in March, the Department rose to the challenge to maintain its support of community investment by implementing new safety measures that allowed the Permit Center to reopen, field Inspections to be completed and long-term planning initiatives to be advanced.</p>
