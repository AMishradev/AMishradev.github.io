	<h1>Youth Council</h1>

	<div>
		<p>The Torrance Youth Council is an advisory body to the City Council on matters pertaining to youth in Torrance. Youth Council  is comprised of two members representing each of the Torrance high schools, El Camino College, California Academy of Math and Science,  and two members-at-large.  Some projects the Youth Council is currently working are: annual Holiday Boutiques to raise funds to donate to community youth projects and their Beat the Odds Scholarship Program; Youth Forum Day; volunteer assistance and support in community/civic events; and participation in the National Junior State of America Program dealing with other youth and current political issues.  All meetings are open to the public, and young people are encouraged to address the Council on any items related to youth.  Applications for Youth Council membership are accepted each May.  Following the selection process, new members are installed in August.</p>
