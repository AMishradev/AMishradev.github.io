	<h1>Partners in Police</h1>

	<div class="text1">
		<p>The next Partners in Policing Class will be held in Spring 2022 (coming soon). To join the class, you will need to fill out a Partners In Policing Form. This program is open to all Torrance residents, people that work in Torrance and anyone else that has affiliations with the City (i.e. people that attend school in Torrance, are members of a church in Torrance, members of civic organizations based in Torrance such as Kiwanis, Rotary, Chamber of Commerce, etc).  Must be 18 or older.  Registration for this class fills up quickly.  </p>

	<div class="text1">
		<p>"Partners In Policing" is a Community Awareness Program that educates the community through those who are currently the closest to us, our Neighborhood Watch Members along with community members and business organizations.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text1">
		<p>The Program allows for the community to "walk in the shoes of an officer," and experience hands-on exercises relating to the duties, services and responsibilities of policing.  Participants will meet officers from the Gang Detail, SWAT, K9 Detail, and interact with a variety of officers from the details within the department.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text1">
		<p>Through the Partners In Policing Program the community gains a better understanding of the policing function and The Police Department in turn receives valuable input regarding the community policing needs.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text1">
		<p>As of this date we have graduated 44 classes totaling over 1,000 community members.  Classes with 25-40 participants are held twice a year.  By graduation time, the participants have gone through 11 sessions involving everything from the police academy to the apprehension and prosecution of criminals.  They have learned why we do certain things and had the opportunity to actually experience certain training scenarios.</p>

	<h2>Teens and Policing</h2>

	<div class="text2">
		<p>The Torrance Police Department, in partnership with the Torrance Unified School District, has an exciting and innovative program for select juniors and seniors attending one of the TUSD High Schools.  “Teens and Policing” (TAP) is a 12-week program held at the Torrance Police Department one night of the week from 6-8 PM.  This program is offered once per semester (Fall and Spring), and students earn school credits upon successful completion of the program.   Students are selected by their counselor. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="text2">
		<p>Interactions between students and police will strengthen relationships and build partnerships toward the future as participants become young adults.  They will meet the Chief of Police, take a tour of the station, witness demonstrations from the SWAT team and K-9 unit, hear from the DUI team, Gang Detail, Detectives, and other specialty units.  The students will have the unique opportunity to see and do things that only police officers get to experience.</p>
