	<h1>Below are everything you need to know about accesing alarm permits in the City Of Torrance</h1>

	<div>
		<p>In 1989, the Torrance City Council enacted an ordinance, Section 38.1.3 TMC, requiring all residences and business having alarm systems to obtain a permit for the alarm system.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>SECTION 38.1.3. PERMIT REQUIRED</h2>

	<div>
		<p>a) No person shall install or have installed or maintain on any premises under his control an alarm system without first applying for and obtaining an alarm system permit therefore in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.</p>
		<p>b) No alarm system installer or alarm company shall install an alarm system unless a permit under this Chapter has been issued and remains in force for the location. In order to obtain a permit a fee must be paid.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			The Ordinance also provides a section that states "No alarm system permit fee shall be charged for issuance of a permit where the applicant is sixty-five (65) years of age, or older, or physically disabled and who resides at the location for which
the permit is requested."
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>On July 1, 2003 the alarm fees were updated by the City Council. Under the updated ordinance all businesses and residences within the City of Torrance which have a burglary, robbery or other alarm system installed must obtain a permit. The alarm permit is issued by the Business Licensing Division (310-618-5828) of the City of Torrance. An application must be filled out and a fee* must be paid at the time the permit is issued. This alarm permit fee is good for a period of one year. On the anniversary of the issuance of the alarm permit, the home or business owner will be billed for an alarm permit renewal fee*. If you change locations and install another alarm system you must obtain a new permit.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			The City Council included a false alarm fee schedule in the ordinance, 38.4.2 TMC, for fines to be charged for responses to false alarms. The ordinance provides three (3) free responses, by the Torrance Police Department, to false burglary alarms in a calendar year. Beginning with the fourth (4) false burglary alarm in a calendar year, and every false burglary alarm after that, a fee* will be assessed for police response. The ordinance also states that there will be no free responses to false robbery alarms (this section also covers panic and duress alarms). Each and every robbery, panic or duress alarm that is false will be assessed a fee* for police response. The Police Department responds to every alarm called in. We also become very concerned when false alarm calls begin to rise. There are steps that the public can take to keep the number of false alarm calls at a minimum. If you would like more information, please contact the Technical Services Detail at 310-618-5721, Monday through Friday between the hours of 8am and 4pm.
