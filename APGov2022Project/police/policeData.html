	<h2>Crime Map</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Welcome to our web based Crime Pin Map.  This map was designed to provide information for 12 specific incidents (crimes) reported throughout the City. This Crime Pin Map does not depict all crimes.  For these 12 selected crimes (refer to legend in the map), you can use the Pin Map to view an actual "description" of the crime to get more detailed information of what occurred.</p>
		<p>The most recent information posted to the Crime Pin Map is a minimum of four days old.  This is to give time for preliminary investigations and to ensure the crime is coded properly.  The map only retains the last 45 days of reported incidents due to server storage space.  For crimes older than 45 days, please refer to the Weekly Crime Logs listed below and select by date desired.</p>
