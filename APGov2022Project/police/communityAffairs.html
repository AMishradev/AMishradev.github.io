		<p>The Community Affairs Division is responsible for Crime Prevention, Community Outreach programs and is the liaison between the Department and the Community.  Over the past years, we have undergone a number of changes in an effort to be more responsive to the needs of the Community and to provide better services to our citizens.  We have added a number of programs and services and linked all of them to our website.   You can communicate with us directly via e-mail at  CommunityAffairs@TorranceCA.gov or via phone at (310) 618-6391/6392/5735.</p>
