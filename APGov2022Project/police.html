		The Torrance Police Department mission is to preserve public safety and quality of life within the City of Torrance, to respond effectively to the changing needs of the community, and to promote mutual respect between the Police Department and the people we serve. The Department's primary concern is community safety. The men and women of the Torrance Police Department are wholeheartedly committed to the goal of keeping our neighborhoods free from crime. From the officers on patrol to the officers in our schools teaching children; from the Chief to the newest rookie officer...all maintain a strong spirit of commitment and service to the Torrance community. In return the Department enjoys a very high level of community support, without which we would not be as successful as we are.
