		George Chen was first elected to City Council on June 5, 2018.  On Jun 19, 2018, City Council adopted an ordinance establishing by district elections for City Council offices.  On March 3, 2020 he was elected to be the first Councilmember representing District 2.

 He currently serves as the chair of the Strategic Plan Committee. In addition, he is a member of the Employee Relations and Public Safety Committee and the Financial and Governmental Operations Committee and a board member representing the city in the Southbay Cities Council of Government. He was previously the chair of the Employee Relations Safety Committee and a member of the Strategic Plan Committee and Community Plan and Design Committee

George is a graduate of UCLA with a degree in Electrical Engineering. Prior to becoming a councilmember, George had a successful 33-year career with Raytheon (formerly Hughes Aircraft Company) working on Electronic Warfare and Airborne Fire Control Systems in both system engineering and program management. 

George has been blessed to pursue the American Dream, and now has the opportunity to give back to America and the community that he calls home. George envisions Torrance as the “Silicon Valley in the South Bay,” and sees the opportunity to be known as the center of excellence for business and technology innovation — a place where the best talents in the world flock to incubate new ideas and where domestic and international entrepreneurs seek to invest.

In addition, George would like to combine his passion for athletics and sports with his interest in developing youth by creating new opportunities for young Torrance athletes to excel.

George and his wife are active members at their church in Torrance. George Chen has been a resident of Torrance since 1992 and has lived in the South Bay since the late 1960’s after emigrating from Taiwan.
